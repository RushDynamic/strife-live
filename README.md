# Strife Live
Strife Live is a wrapper library for VoIP using WebRTC.
It is a plug-and-play solution that takes care of the underlying WebRTC configuration, making it easier for you to implement VoIP in your projects.

## Examples
You can find examples of how to create and accept calls, and a basic signalling server powered by Socket.IO inside the [examples](https://github.com/RushDynamic/strife-live/tree/develop/examples) folder
